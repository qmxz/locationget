# locationget
a tool which can transform address to latitude and longitude
first you should get you own api key via amap service[amap-api](https://lbs.amap.com/api/webservice/guide/api/georegeo)
put yourkey in xy.py 
then you should install requirements and put you address in address.xls
 **important: your input shoule obey that amap need.**
you can run xy.py finally and get what you need.
a dual input version was in plan B ,which you need to input both address and city,that you can get more accurate latitude and longitude.
** P.S: this is an easy sample to use amap's web api, maybe the output have some trouble.
